# Plagcheck
The main goal of this project is to build a plagiarism checker that can detect copied content from both
AI-generated and manually written text. It uses natural language processing (NLP) to compare input text
with existing data sources and identify similarities, even in rephrased or paraphrased content. This tool
aims to ensure content originality and academic honesty by generating a clear plagiarism report that
shows the percentage of matched content and possible sources. It is designed to be accurate, fast, and
useful in the age of AI-driven content creation.

Our current approach involves designing an intelligent plagiarism detection system that
combines traditional algorithms with modern AI techniques. The system is structured to
process and analyze both AI-generated and manually written text.
We are developing a custom AI model using Natural Language Processing (NLP)
techniques. The model focuses on semantic similarity, paraphrase detection, and
keyword analysis to accurately identify not just exact matches but also rephrased or
contextually similar content. Algorithms such as cosine similarity, Jaccard index, and
TF-IDF are being implemented to compare input data with existing sources

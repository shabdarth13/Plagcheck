Abstract: The paper suggests a novel method for using hand motions to create a virtual mouse interface. There are drawbacks to the conventional mouse and keyboard interface, especially in situations when users need to engage without using their hands, like in augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and smart surroundings. It attempts to create a reliable and user-friendly system that allows people to control a computer cursor using hand movements recorded by a camera by utilizing computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms .Cursor control, gesture recognition, and hand detection are three of the main parts of the proposed system. Finding and following the user's hand within the camera's range of vision is known as hand detection. Techniques including skin colour segmentation, backdrop subtraction, and deep learning-based object detection may be used in this procedure. 
 
Keywords: convolutional neural networks (CNNs), virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), hand gesture recognition systems. 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
 
A virtual mouse, powered by hand gestures, revolutionizes human-computer interaction by eliminating the need for physical peripherals, enabling intuitive control over digital environments. Utilizing computer vision and machine learning algorithms, this technology translates hand movements into cursor actions, mimicking the functionalities of a traditional mouse without the physical device .The system typically involves a camera, which captures real-time images of the user's hand gestures. Advanced image processing algorithms identify and track the user's hand movements, recognizing specific gestures that correspond to mouse actions such as cursor movement, clicking, dragging, and scrolling. These gestures are mapped to predefined actions, allowing users to navigate through graphical user interfaces seamlessly. One of the primary advantages of a virtual mouse is its accessibility. Unlike traditional mice, which require fine motor skills to operate, virtual mice using hand gestures cater to individuals with mobility impairments, making computing more inclusive. Additionally, the absence of physical hardware reduces clutter and simplifies setups, particularly in environments where space is limited .Furthermore, virtual mouse technology enhances user immersion in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) environments. By integrating hand gesture recognition, VR and AR applications can offer users a more immersive and natural interaction experience, allowing them to manipulate digital objects with their hands as they would in the physical world.
